When I came home I had about 300 photos, so I narrowed it down the best ones, and used turn.js to make a digital photo album, complete with collections and my favorites at the end. I really love how it came together and it's a great way to remember what I saw and who I met along my trip."

The goal of the class was to look at the effect technology had on interaction with physical media like books, magazines, etc. and what is lost when interacting with physical media through technology. For the final project, we were asked to pick a book from Northwestern's McCormick Library of Special Collections and created a digital version of it. I selected Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks, and created a webpage with original visualizations to highlight word frequency, ligature use, and even a HTML replicate of the cover."

This has been my primary creative outlet throughout quarantine and I've focused from video to video on trying to improve my design, writing, editing, animating, narrating, and general production skills. I've been very lucky to have received a lot of positive feedback, and have loved seeing how many people have enjoyed my videos. If you're looking for a place to start, I'd recommend watching my video on Vulfpeck or Animal Collective's My Girls music video."
